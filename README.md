Clone with git, or download zip, as you want. You can run builded executable, or, build by yourself. But for this make sure that you have c++ compiler and IDE.

### Libraries
Make a folder "build" in our main direcrory, parallel with main.

From [official website](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) download Eigen (Library for vector math computations), and place the "Eigen" folder into the build folder, it's ready!
From [yaml-cpp github](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) download source, find `yaml-cpp/include/yaml-cpp` folder, and place deeper `yaml-cpp` to the build folder.
